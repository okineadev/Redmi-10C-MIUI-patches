## üõ†Ô∏è Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **OS**: **Linux** (Recommended), **WSL** or **Windows** (Not recommended)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (Required)
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation) to run Python (Optional)

  You can download this firmware from here: <https://xmfirmwareupdater.com/miui/fog/stable/V14.0.8.0.TGEMIXM>

## üì¶ Unpacking the Archive

1. Copy the ROM archive to a convenient directory.
2. Verify the MD5 checksum:

   ```bash
   md5sum fog_global_images_V14.0.8.0.TGEMIXM_20240828.0000.00_13.0_global_356db336fa.tgz
   ```

   ```

3. Extract the archive:

   ```bash
   tar -xf fog_global_images_V14.0.8.0.TGEMIXM_20240828.0000.00_13.0_global_356db336fa.tgz
   ```

## ü©π Applying the Patches

1. Copy the patch folder from this repository to the folder with the extracted ROM
2. Apply all basic patches:

   ```bash
   for patch in patches/*.patch; do
       git apply "$patch"
   done
   ```

   To find out what these patches do, you can read the patch files, they describe in human language what has been changed.
